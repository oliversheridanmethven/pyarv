Mention that it is the users responsibility to ensure input is sufficiently sanitised, and we do not make any guarantees about subnormal numbers, the exact values of zero and 1, minus zero, nan, signalling nan, etc. Similarly, we require the user to preallocate correct arrays with suitable alignment and correct lengths, and all the rest. We trust the user to read the documentation and write correct code.^^E^^L
