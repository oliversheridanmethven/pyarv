\begin{itemize}
\item Higher order polynomials

\item More dyadic intervals.

\item high accuracy approximations.


\item Parametrised distributions.

\item Asymmetric distributions.

\item Custom distributions.

\item For the custom distributions, showcase for a variety of these how fast they are.

\item Discuss distributions which do not have an L2 norm, such as the Cauchy distribution, and how this related to the proofs in the ACM toms paper.
