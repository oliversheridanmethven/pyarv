Decide what I want to do here for testing. I can either require some tests written using Criterion, write my own tests, (e.g. using static assert), or just have all my tests written in the Python layer. All that really needs testing from \arv is the approximation.h functions which do some type punning, getting indices from floats. I am hesitant to say that it is really so trivial it doesn't need testing... (certainly doesn't warrant an entire testing library).^^E^^L
