# Contributing

There is lots of work to be done to get this project into good shape,
and *many* opportunities for newcomers to contribute to the project.

To see a full list of things that would be good to work on, see 
[the list of issues that are being tracked](https://github.com/oliversheridanmethven/pyarv/issues).

In order to start contributing, you will need the following:

* To be able to build all the source code for the project from scratch (both 
an in-source and out-of-source builds), and run all the tests locally. This will
require installing several packages, compilers, etc. 

After you have passed this milestone, please feel free to contribute in any-way,
big or small, major or minor.

If you would like to know where your could best apply your skills, or where
the maintainers think work would have the biggest impact, then feel free to
reach out to the maintainers directly, or just ask on GitHub.
