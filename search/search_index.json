There is an ABI incompatability between the two,  so on Mac something compiled with Clang can't be linked with something  compiled with GCC, because they use two differing implementations  of the C++ standard library. (On Linux both compilers use <code>libc++</code> so this isn't as much of an issue).</p> <p>Consequently, if on your Mac you install some standard libraries, such as  e.g. Boost, which might contain non-header-only (e.g. program options),  then on Mac then brew will likely default to Clang. This can start to lead down a rabit hole of trying to compile everything with differing compilers and standard library versions. </p> <p>Currently, the authors, who develop this on a Mac, haven't found a nice solution for this.
