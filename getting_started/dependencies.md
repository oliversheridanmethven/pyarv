# Dependencies

# Python

For the core routines you will require. 

- Python 3.12 or newer, (only because we use the latest nested f-string features).
- NumPy.

To run the demos, plots, or speed tests, then you will need 
some extra packages. To ensure you install all of these 
you can do a `pip install pyarv[dev]`.

# C

- A C99 compiler supporting `-fopenmp`, or newer. 
- OpenMP support. 

# Other

Some of the other tools you will need include (recent versions assumed):

- CMake.
- Git.
- A POSIX filesystem.
