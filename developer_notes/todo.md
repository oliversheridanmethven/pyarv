# TODO



There are various things I would like to add to this repo, including:

- Git hooks:
  - Publishing documentation. 
  - Generating code documentation with MkDoxy2. 
    - Add C/C++ code documentation with Doxygen. 
  - Ensuring build succeeds and tests pass. 
- Assert compiler requirements. 
- Ship with dependencies. 
- Add code formatter (e.g. clangd).
